<h2>Overall: <span class="okay">Okay</span></h2>

* Played: 5+ hours
* Victories: 1 three-island, 1 two-island
* Losses: 10

I have a lot of locked and unexplored content and might not have given it as
much of a chance as it deserved, but the cons noted below really hampered my
enjoyment.

### Great

<ul class="great">
  <li>Every battle is a bite-sized puzzle</li>
  <li>Small-scale tactics is unique</li>
  <li>Shove mechanic is very cool, but hard to adapt to</li>
  <li>Excellent spritework</li>
</ul>

### Good

<ul class="good">
  <li>Easy to pick up and play</li>
  <li>High replayability</li>
  <li>Procedural content feels authentic</li>
</ul>

### Okay

<ul class="okay">
  <li>Choice of battle rarely felt impactful</li>
  <li>Carryover between runs isn't very significant</li>
  <li>Strategy is not apparent to me</li>
  <li>Every battle is played on the defense</li>
</ul>

### Bad

<ul class="bad">
  <li>Though small, battles are very stressful; I never feel like I'm winning, just triaging</li>
  <li>Some turns feel unwinnable, which is frustrating; on the flip side, chancing upon a good solution is very rewarding</li>
</ul>
