### Great

<ul class="great">
  <li>So, so beautiful</li>
  <li>Unique art style</li>
  <li>No frame stutters</li>
  <li>Solid pacing</li>
  <li>Focused gameplay
    <ul>
      <li>No filler</li>
      <li>Simple mechanics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Great map</li>
  <li>Rewarding exploration</li>
  <li>Mobility upgrades enable a lot of fun sequences</li>
  <li>Misty Woods had a super cool and unique zone mechanic</li>
  <li>"Dungeon" zones were all very unique</li>
</ul>


### Good

<ul class="good">
  <li>Unique and charming story</li>
  <li>On-demand checkpoints take some adjusting to, but work quite well</li>
</ul>


### Okay

<ul class="okay">
  <li>Black Root Burrows ostensibly requires a light-producing power to explore, but actually doesn't</li>
  <li>Often unclear whether an upgrade is acquirable with current abilities</li>
</ul>


### Bad

<ul class="bad">
  <li>Platforming is slippery, making the first 1-2 hours very unforgiving. Mobility / health upgrades relieve this</li>
  <li>Some mid-game talents apply to optional abilities I didn't get until post-game</li>
</ul>
